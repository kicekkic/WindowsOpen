# Introduction
One day I thought that I have enough of the hidden telemetry and bloatware that Microsoft gives us in our system so I decided to make my own (there are lots of them) collection of stuff you can do to optimize your computer. I will be attaching scripts and websites that I researched and made sure that they are safe. As I said earlier, there are thousands of other repositories like that but this one is my own because honestly, you can't really trust people these days - and I know that Im also on the same level of trustworthiness as other people but Its up to you what you will do with the information here (and I have no idea how you found my rep).
## Debloating
Debloating will be separated into different categories:
### Core


## Optimizing

## Extras
